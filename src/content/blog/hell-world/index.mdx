Hey, I'm Allen Hansen, a full-stack software developer specializing in building
web apps and microservices. I'm passionate about leveraging web standards to
create accessible and intuitive user experiences that perform at scale.

I am starting a blog with the hopes of creating my own personalized knowledge
base and to foster an environment where I can explore new ideas and receive
feedback from the community at large.

I recently watched a personal productivity talk [1] by
[Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com) where he touches on the idea that
_"You have a finite number of keystrokes left in your hands before you die."_
[1], [2], [3] and that _"Email is where keystrokes go to die."_ [1].

According to [keysleft.com](https://keysleft.com), a site created by
[Scott Hanselman](https://www.hanselman.com), I have approximately `232,127,739`
keystrokes remaining in my life.

I aim to use my keystrokes wisely and hope that this blog will help me to
increase my _"keystrokes potential"_ [1].
